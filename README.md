## Introduction
This project presents a low-cost and efficient method for detecting and quantifying Epiretinal Membranes (ERM) using Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). By applying deep learning techniques—specifically, YOLO object detection—we generate en face "ERM Projection Images" from B-scan data, enabling intuitive visualization and accurate measurement of ERM areas. The method also introduces a novel approach to quantify the association between ERM and retinal thickness, enhancing clinical decision-making. Our approach aims to bridge the diagnostic performance gap between SD-OCT and Swept-Source OCT (SS-OCT) while maintaining accessibility and reducing diagnostic burden.
